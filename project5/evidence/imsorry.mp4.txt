To Dad, 

I just wanted to let you know that I am sorry for everyhting that has happened. I have chosen a life of crime but one day we will be able to reunite. That day will be glorious. I hope that you can forgive me. We can establish a covert channel through which I can send you my address to send letters. I just wanted you to know that I appreciate everything that you do. This is going to be rough but SDSC deserved it. I hope that they perish. 

Love,

Leslie
